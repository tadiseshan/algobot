# algobot

@AlgoHeadlines is a twitter bot that parses a Google News RSS feed with the search query 'algorithm' and tweets headlines from the results. 

I've been curious about the ways in which the word 'algorithm' has entered conversations in new ways, so this was my way of starting to take a look at those conversations. 

Many thanks to [Molly White's tutorial](http://blog.mollywhite.net/twitter-bots-pt1/) for helping me get started!
